#+title:  Intro to ML (Trainocate)
* Machine learning
* What about machine learning
** Model
*** What is it
- it contains the parameters to derive the certain rules
- derives rules from the data
- adapts to complexities
*** Trained Algorithm
- Reversed math
- nasaatin yung sagot tapos ittrain natin yung model para makita yung math equation na parang makakadescribe best nung probem
** Parts?
\begin{math}
f(x) = ax_{0} + ax_{1}+  ... +ax_{n}
\end{math}
*** Features
- usually x
*** Weights
- usually a
- a has infinite values
- if alam na yung mga a values meron na tayong model
*** After getting weights
- after makuha yung function dun magbbase yung mga labels o clasifications
* Supervised learning
- assumes there is data a priori
- y can represent yes or no, continous value, etc

** Binary Classification
** Multiclass Classification
** Regression Problem
- meron siyang exact vaue na pwede siya ilabas
- y is continuous
- predicting future value of stock
- time series usually regression
* Unsupervised
- no y value
- you make your own labels
- clustering data
  - *HOMOGENEOUS GROUPS*
** Use case
* Reinforcement Learning
- learning through trial and error
- best when desired outcome is known but the exact path to acchieving is no
- gives negative score then machine tries to do something different
- penalize or reward ceertain behavior
- has a policy or function constraint
* Deep learning
can learn on its own
** Artificial neural networks
- modeled based on our brain
- first layer of neurons are the x's
  difference with reinforcement learning
  - is still basically a classification problem
  - optimizes weights instead of final score
  - does not have a policy
*** bias
*** Signal
- baically f(x) or yung answer dun sa mga calculations na ginawa nung mga weights and features
*** Activation function
model
function na inaapply sa Signal para makakuha ng prediction
