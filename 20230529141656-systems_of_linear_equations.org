* Singular vs NonSingular

| Singular        | NonSingular                            |
|-----------------+----------------------------------------|
| unique solution | infinite/no solutions                  |
| complete        | redundant/contradictory                |
|                 | first row is a multiple of second rows |
|-----------------+----------------------------------------|

- The name comes from complete, redundant, and contradicting systems of equation when these equations are plotted in a plane and the equations are equated to zero
- non singular will have 2 lines intersecting at origin
- singular will become one line only

* Determinant
determines if matrix is singular or non-singular

\begin{equation}
x=\sqrt{b}
\end{equation}
